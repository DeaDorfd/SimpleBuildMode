# Simple BuildMode
Simple BuildMode is a plugin that will no longer allow players to build / break. 
Server owners now have the option to build or break down again by issuing a command.

## How to Install?

1. Download the plugin on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/110436/) and put it in your plugins folder. 
2. restart your server. 
3. Have fun :)

## How to use?
First of all, the build mode is always off, which means that you always have to enter the command.
Use the /Build command first.
Then you can start directly.
If you want to give the build mode to your friend or a user but not to him, use the /Build <player-name> command.

## Permissions and Commands
All Permissions can be set in the Config!
The Permissions are behind the" | ". (default Permissions)

/Build | system.build
/Build <player-name> | system.build.other
